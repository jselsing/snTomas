\begin{abstract}
SN \tomas\ is a Type Ia Supernova (\SNIa) discovered at $z=1.33$
behind the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 ($z=0.308$). This SN has a
projected separation from the cluster core of $\sim$40\arcsec, closer
than any other cluster-lensed \SNIa.  As such, it provides the first
opportunity to confront gravitational lens models of galaxy clusters
with the direct measurement of an absolute magnification at the edge
of the strong-lensing region.  We derive a tightly constrained measure
of the peak apparent magnitude, corrected for light curve shape and
exinction.  In a cosmology-independent analysis, we find that \tomas\
is $0.71\pm0.12$ magnitudes brighter than unlensed \SNeIa\ at similar
redshift, implying a lensing magnification of $\mu_{\rm
obs}=1.9\pm0.2$.  Predicted magnifications from 7 independent groups
are systematically biased to higher values, with a mean of $\mu_{\rm
mod}=2.4\pm0.3$ and some models disagreeing by $>6\sigma$.  The most
significant discrepancies arise from models with a strict ``light
traces mass'' assumption.  We evaluate possible causes for this bias,
including variation of the mass-to-light ratio in the nearest cluster
member galaxy.  A sample of \textcolor{red}{$\sim$10??} \SNeIa\ behind
any single cluster could provide a robust evaluation of systematic
biases in lens models.  Until such a sample exists, it is advisable to
increase the estimated uncertainty of any predicted magnification
by an amount comparable to the dispersion from all available lens
models.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Massive galaxy clusters can be used as cosmic telescopes to magnify
distant background objects through gravitational lensing.  This can
substantially increase the reach of deep imaging surveys, and has
recently been used to discover candidate proto-galaxies formed in the
first Gyr after the Big
Bang \citep{Zheng:2012,Coe:2013,} 
\textcolor{red}{(cite other high-z galaxy candidates discovered with lensing)}

Lensed SNe have been discovered

SN 2011fe at $z=1.31$ and $t=-3$ rest-frame days before peak
brightness.  Allowing a correction for the broad SED shape using
3rd-order polynomials, the best match is from SN 2012cg at $z=1.31$
and $t=+3 days$.

\subsection{Comparison to Model Predictions}
\label{sec:ComparisonToModelPredictions}


1) All of the lens models predict a higher magnification than we observe, some with discrepancies >5 sigma.  This suggests a systematic bias inherent to all the models -- at least for this particular line of sight. 

2) the addition of new lensing constraints from the HFF data does not reduce the tension.  From both of the most recent models (Jauzac+ 2014 and Lam+ 2014) the predicted magnification is still significantly higher than the observed. 

3) The pre-HFF models that come closest to matching the observed magnification are the Zitrin-NFW and Merten models (also the Williams model, though it has very large uncertainties).  Those happen to be two models that relax or remove the assumption of light-traces-mass.
