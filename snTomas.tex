\begin{abstract}
SN \tomas\ is a Type Ia Supernova (\SNIa) discovered at $z=1.31\pm0.01$
behind the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 ($z=0.308$). This SN has a
projected separation from the cluster core of $\sim$40\arcsec, closer
than any other cluster-lensed \SNIa.  As such, it provides the first
opportunity to confront gravitational lens models of galaxy clusters
with the direct measurement of an absolute magnification at the edge
of the strong-lensing region.  We derive a tightly constrained measure
of the peak apparent magnitude, corrected for light curve shape and
exinction.  In a cosmology-independent analysis, we find that \tomas\
is $0.75\pm0.10$ magnitudes brighter than unlensed \SNeIa\ at similar
redshift, implying a lensing magnification of $\mu_{\rm
obs}=2.00\pm0.19$.  We compare this direct measurement of the
magnification against predicted magnifications from 11 lens models,
representing a broad range of methodologies and incorporating a
variety of strong- and weak-lensing constraints.  The models are
collectively fairly accurate, with a naive unweighted mean of
$\mu_{\rm mod}=2.6$.  However, they are systematically biased to
higher values: none of the tested models predict a magnification equal
to or lower than the observed $\mu$, and some models are more than
$5\sigma$ above the measured magnification.  We evaluate possible
causes for this bias, and find that intercomparison of the lens models
rules out several simple possibilities.  A larger sample of
$\sim$10 \SNeIa\ behind any single cluster could provide a robust
evaluation of systematic biases in lens models.  Until such a sample
exists, it is advisable to increase the estimated uncertainty of any
predicted magnification by an amount comparable to the dispersion from
all available lens models.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

\textcolor{red}{TODO: write and polish introduction}.
Massive galaxy clusters can be used as cosmic telescopes to magnify
distant background objects through gravitational lensing.  This can
substantially increase the reach of deep imaging surveys, and has
recently been used to discover candidate proto-galaxies formed in the
first Gyr after the Big 
Bang \citep{Zheng:2012,Coe:2013} 
\textcolor{red}{(cite other high-z galaxy candidates discovered with lensing)}

\textcolor{red}{TODO: describe past examples of lensed SN studies  \citep{Goobar:2009,Riehm:2011,Quimby:2014}.}

\citet[][hereafter P14]{Patel:2014} and \citet{Nordin:2014} presented
independent analyses of three lensed SNe, of which at least 2 are securely
classified as Type Ia SNe.  All of these three objects were found in
the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH,
PI:Postman, HST Program ID 12068). 


In Section~\ref{sec:DiscoveryAndFollowup} we present the discovery and
follow-up observations of SN \tomas at $z=1.31$, discovered behind the
galaxy cluster Abell 2744.  Sections~\ref{sec:Spectroscopy} and \ref{sec:PhotometricClassification}
describe the spectroscopy and photometry of this SN, leading to a
classification of the object as a normal Type Ia SN.  In
Section~\ref{sec:Magnification} we make a direct measurement of
the magnification of this source due to gravitational lensing, and
compare to predictions from lens models.  Finally,
Section~\ref{sec:Discussion} discusses the tension between our
magnification measurement and the lens models, with implications for
the systematic error budget in magnification estimates for other
high-$z$ lensed sources.

\end{center}
\end{figure*}


SN \tomas\ was discovered in Hubble Space Telescop (\HST) observations
with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) in the F606W and F814W
bands (V and i), collected on UT 2014 May 15 as part of the Hubble
Frontier Fields (HFF) survey (PI:J.Lotz,
HST-PID:13495).\footnote{\url{http://www.stsci.edu/hst/campaigns/frontier-fields}}
The HFF program is a 3-year director's discretionary initiative that
is collecting 140 orbits of HST imaging (roughly 340 ksec) on six
massive galaxy clusters, plus 6 accompanying parallel fields.
Each field is observed in 3 optical bands (ACS F435W, F606W and F814W)
and 4 infrared (IR) bands (WFC3-IR F105W, F125W, F140W, and F160W),
although the optical and IR imaging campaigns are separated by $\sim$6
months. Abell 2744 was the first cluster observed, with IR imaging
spanning 2013 October-November, and optical imaging from 2014
May-July.  A composite image of the HFF data showing the SN is
presented in Figure~\ref{fig:DiscoveryImage}.  The SN detection was
made in difference images constructed using template imaging of Abell
2744 from HST+ACS observations taken in 2009 (PI:Dupke,
HST-PID:11689).

\input{TABLE/photometry}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{FIG/host_sed_fit}
\caption{  \label{fig:HostSED}
Best-fit SED template match for the most probable \tomas\ host
galaxy. Using the {\it BPZ} code to match the observed SED, we find
the nearest galaxy to the SN position is a late type galaxy with a
photometric redshift of $z=1.5\pm0.2$.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The most probable host galaxy for SN \tomas\ is a faint and diffuse
galaxy immediately to the south-east of the SN location.  With
photometry of the host galaxy collected from the template images, we
fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) using the {\it BPZ} code --
a Bayesian photometric redshift estimator \citep{Benitez:2000}. The
best-fit SED template match is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HostSED}.
From the {\it BPZ} analysis, we found the host to be most likely an
actively star-forming galaxy at a redshift of $z=1.5\pm0.2$.  Another
nearby bright galaxy to the East of the SN has a spectroscopic
redshift of $z=1.742$, making it most likely a background object.
This redshift was determined from a spectrum taken with the G141 grism
of the HST WFC3-IR camera, collected as part of the Grism Lens
Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS, PI:Treu, PID:13459).

Upon discovery, HST target-of-opportunity observations were triggered
from the FrontierSN program (PI:Rodney, HST-PID:13386), which aims to
discover and follow transient sources in the HFF cluster and parallel
fields. The FrontierSN observations provided WFC3-IR imaging as well
as spectroscopy using the ACS G800L grism, supplementing the
rapid-cadence optical imaging from HST+ACS already being provided by
the HFF program. Difference images for the IR follow-up data were
generated using templates constructed from the HFF WFC3-IR imaging
campaign, which concluded in November, 2013.

All of the imaging data were processed using the {\tt sndrizpipe}
pipeline,\footnote{\url{https://github.com/srodney/sndrizpipe} v1.2
DOI:10.5281/zenodo.10731} a custom data reduction package in Python
that is employs the {\tt DrizzlePac} tools from the Space Telescope
Science Institute (STScI) \citep{Fruchter:2010}.  Photometry was
collected using the {\tt PyPhot} software
package,\footnote{\url{https://github.com/djones1040/PyPhot}} a
pure-Python implementation of the photometry algorithms from the IDL
AstroLib package \citep{Landsman:1993}, which in turn are based on the
DAOPHOT program \citep{Stetson:1987}.  For the IR bands we used point
spread function (PSF) fitting on the difference images, and in the ACS
optical bands we collected photometry with a
0\farcs3 aperture. Table~\ref{tab:Photometry} presents the list of
observations, along with measured photometry from all available
imaging data.
 


\section{Spectroscopy}
\label{sec:Spectroscopy}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{FIG/specfit}

arbitrary units, and the x axis marks wavelength in \AA\ with the
observer-frame on the bottom and rest-frame on the top.
The \tomas\ spectrum observed with the
HST ACS G800L grism is shown in black, overlaid with model fits
derived from a library of Type Ia templates that have extended
rest-frame UV coverage.  {\it Top}: The best match is at $z=1.31$ with
age=$+3$ days, from the normal Type Ia SN 2012cg template when using a
smooth 3rd-order polynomial to warp the shape of the template
pseudo-continuum.  When the templates are not warped, an acceptable
fit can be found with a normal Type Ia at $z=1.31$ (middle) or at
$z\sim1$ (bottom), although the latter is inconsistent with the host
galaxy redshift prior and the light curve. No \CCSN\ templates can
provide a statistically acceptable fit at any redshift, within the age
constraints imposed by the light curve.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


A spectrum of SN \tomas\ was collected with the ACS G800L grism on
2014 June 4 and 7, when the SN was very near to its peak brightness.
The observations -- listed at the bottom of Table~\ref{tab:Photometry}
-- used 5 HST orbits from the FrontierSN program for a total
spectroscopic exposure time of $\sim$10 ksec.  The grism data were
processed and the target spectrum was extracted using the custom
pipeline employed by the Grism Lens Amplified Survey from Space
program (GLASS; PI:Treu, PID:13459). \textcolor{red}{Is there a
citation for this? or more to say here?}  

Figure~\ref{fig:SpecFit} shows the composite 1-D ACS grism spectrum,
combining all available G800L exposures, overlaid with SN model fits
that will be described below.  The spectrum is largely free of
contamination, because the orientation was chosen to avoid nearby
bright sources and the host galaxy is diffuse and optically faint.
Thus, the SN spectral features can be unambiguously identified, most
notably the red slope of the continuum and a prominent absorption
feature at $\sim$8700\AA.  However, the signal to noise ratio (S/N)
for the host galaxy spectrum was too weak to yield any additional
constraints on the host type or redshift.

As described below, we fit the SN \tomas\ spectrum in two steps.
First we determine a spectral classification -- and get a preliminary
estimate of the redshift and age -- using the SuperNova IDentification
(SNID) software \citep{Blondin:2007}.  Second, we refine the redshift
and age measurement using a custom Type Ia spectral template matching
program.

\subsection{Classification with SNID}
\label{sec:SNID}

The SNID program is designed to estimate the type, redshift, and age
of a SN spectrum through cross-correlation matching with a library of
template spectra.  To account for possible distortions in the broad
shape of the SN pseudo-continuum due to dust or instrumental
calibration effects, SNID divides each SED by a smooth cubic spline
fit. This effectively removes the shape of the SN pseudo-continuum to
leave behind a flat SED superimposed with spectral absorption and
emission features.  It is these features which drive the
cross-correlation fit, so the SNID approach is insensitive to the
overall color of the SED.  We used v2.0 of the SNID template library,
which includes template SEDs covering all Type Ia and Core Collapse
sub-classes, and has recently been updated with corrections and
improvements to the Type Ib/c templates \citep{Liu:2014}.

In SNID the goodness of fit is evaluated primarily through the {\it
rlap} parameter, which measures the degree of wavelength overlap and
the strength of the cross-correlation peak.  Typically, an {\it rlap}
value $>5$ is required to be considered an acceptable match.  

To match the SN \tomas\ spectrum we use conservative constraints on
age and redshift: limiting the age to $\pm$5 rest-frame days of peak
brightness and $0.8<z<1.8$, consistent with the SN light curve and
host galaxy photo-$z$.  With these constraints we find that the only
acceptable match is a normal Type Ia SN near $z=1.3$. The best match
has {\it rlap}$=8.7$, using the normal Type Ia SN 2005cf at $z=1.35$
and age=-2.2 rest-frame days before peak.  Within these constraints,
the best non-Ia matches all have {\it rlap}$<2.5$.

The {\tt SNID} library can generate an acceptable \CCSN\ match only
when we remove all age and redshift constraints. In this case the best
non-Ia match is the Type Ic SN 1997ef, which delivers {\it rlap}$=6.8$
at $z=0.51$ and age=47.3 rest-frame days past peak.  This is not as
good a fit as the best Type Ia models, is at odds with the host galaxy
redshift prior, and is strongly disfavored by the shape and colors of
the SN light curve (see Section~\ref{sec:PhotometricClassification}).  

From the preceding analysis, we conclude that \tomas\ is a Type Ia SN
at $z\approx1.3$.  At this redshift, the absorption at $\sim$8700\AA\
corresponds to the blended \ion{Ca}{2} H\&K features.
This \ion{Ca}{2} absorption is commonly seen in Type Ia SN spectra
near maximum light, although it is also prominent in the spectra of
Type Ib and Ic core collapse SNe (\CCSNe).  The red color of
the \tomas\ SED is qualitatively consistent with a redshift of $z>1$
-- although this information was not used by {\tt SNID} for the
template matching.  As we will see in Section~\ref{sec:PhotometricClassification},
this spectral classification of SN \tomas\ is reinforced by the
photometric information, which also supports classification as a Type
Ia SN at $z=1.3$.


\subsection{Spectroscopic Redshift}
\label{sec:SpecRedshift}

To refine the redshift and phase constraints on \tomas, we next fit
the spectrum with a custom spectral matching program that employs a
library of Type Ia SN SEDs.  This library is similar to the Type Ia
spectral set used by SNID, but also includes more recent SNe with
well-observed spectral time series that extend to rest-frame UV
wavelengths (e.g. SN 2011fe and 2014J).  We first use an approach
similar to the SNID algorithm: warping the pseudo-continuum of each
template spectrum by dividing out a 3$^{\rm rd}$-order polynomial to
match the observed SED of SN \tomas.  From this analysis we find
results that are consistent with the SNID fits: a redshift of
$z=1.31\pm0.01$ and a phase of $0\pm3$ rest-frame days. The
best-fitting spectral template is the normal Type Ia SN 2012cg, shown
in the bottom panel of Figure~\ref{fig:SpecFit}, which has $\chi^2$
per degree of freedom $\nu$ equal to 42.1/87.

Finally, we repeat the fitting, but without any warping of the
templates to account for differences in the continuum shape.  In this
iteration we only allow each template SED to be scaled in flux
coherently at all wavelengths.  As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SpecFit},
we again find that the \tomas\ SED can be matched by a normal Type Ia
SN (SN 2011fe) at redshift $z=1.31\pm0.01$.  Without the continuum
warping, an alternative fit also arises: the normal Type Ia SN 2011iv
at $z=0.98\pm0.01$. Formally, this match provides a slightly better
fit to the unwarped \tomas\ spectrum, although the fit is notably poor
at $\sim8700$\AA\ where the most significant absorption feature is
found. Furthermore, a redshift $z\sim1$ is at odds with the host
galaxy photo-z ($1.5\pm0.2$), and we will see in the following section
that the photometric data is incompatible with a normal Type Ia SN at
$z\sim1.0$.

Setting aside the $z\sim1$ solution, all other template matches
provide a consistent redshift constraint of $z=1.31\pm0.01$,
regardless of whether the templates are warped to match the SN \tomas\
continuum shape.  The inferred age from these fits is $0\pm3$
rest-frame days from peak brightness, which is also consistent with
the observed light curve.


\section{Photometric Classification}
\label{sec:PhotometricClassification}

Relative to other SNe at $z>1$, the SN \tomas\ light curve was
unusually well sampled at rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths, due to
the rapid cadence of the HFF imaging campaign. These ACS observations
therefore provide a tight constraint on the time of peak brightness
and the evolution of the SN color.  Supplemental observations with the
WFC3-IR camera provided critical rest-frame optical photometry,
enabling a measurement of the apparent luminosity distance through
light curve fitting.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{FIG/snTomas_lightcurve_classification}
\caption{

model selection using the photometric data alone. Grey points show the
observed SN \tomas\ photometry with error bars, though these are typically
smaller than the size of the marker.  The Type Ia model
(orange solid line) is drawn from the SALT2 template at $z=1.35$. The
best match from all Type Ib/Ic models is based on the Type Ic SN
SDSS-14475 at $z=0.695$ (green dashed line). For the Type II class, the
best match is from the Type II-L SN 2007pg at $z=1.8$ (blue dash-dot line). The Type
Ia model is by far the best match, and the only one that is consistent
with both the photo-$z$ of the probable host galaxy and the
spectroscopic redshift from the SN spectrum.
\label{fig:photoclass} }
\end{center}
\end{figure}

As a check on the spectral classification of SN \tomas\
(Section~\ref{sec:SNID}), we independently classified the SN using a
Bayesian photometric classifier.  We use the
{\tt sncosmo} software
package\footnote{\url{http://sncosmo.github.io/}} to simulate SN light
curves from $z=0.3$ to 2.3 and evaluate the classification
probability using traditional Bayesian model selection \citep[as
in][]{Jones:2013,Rodney:2014,Graur:2014,Rodney:2015}.  In this
analysis we represent normal Type Ia SNe with the SALT2
model \citep{Guy:2010}, and \CCSNe\ with 42 discrete templates (26
Type II and 16 Type Ib/c) drawn from the template library of the
SuperNova Analysis software
package \citep[SNANA,][]{Kessler:2009a}.\footnote{Throughout this work
we use SNANA v10\_35g.}
Likelihoods are defined by comparing the observed fluxes to model
predictions in all passbands where the model is defined.  In practice,
this means we exclude the F435W and F606W bands, which are too blue
for our models at $z>0.85$.

The \CCSN\ models have free parameters for date of peak brightness
($t_{\rm pk}$), amplitude, and redshift ($z$). Due to the expected
impact of gravitational lensing magnification, we do not include any
prior on the intrinsic luminosity for any SN sub-class.  We also do
not assign a prior for the SN redshift. This allows our photometric
analysis to provide an independent check on the host galaxy photo-$z$
and spectroscopic redshift (Sections~\ref{sec:DiscoveryAndFollowup}
and \ref{sec:SpecRedshift}).

For Type Ia SNe, the SALT2 model has two additional parameters that
control the shape ($x_1$) and color ($c$) of the light curve.  We use
conservative priors here, defined to encompass a range of Type Ia SN
shapes and colors that is broader than typically allowed in
cosmological analyses \citep[see
e.g.,][]{Kessler:2009b,Sullivan:2011,Rest:2014}. For $x_1$ the prior is
a bifurcated Gaussian distribution with mean $\bar{x}_1=0$, dispersion
$\sigma_{x_1}^+={0.9}$ and $\sigma_{x_1}^-={-1.5}$.  The prior for the
color parameter $c$ has $\bar{c}=0.0$, $\sigma_c^-=0.08$, and
$\sigma_c^+=0.54$.  The $c$ parameter in SALT2 combines intrinsic SN
color and extinction due to dust, so the large red tail of this
distribution allows for the possibility of several magnitudes
of dust extinction along the \tomas\ line of sight.

We also assign a class prior for each of the three primary SN
sub-classes (Type Ia, Ib/c, and II), using a fixed relative fraction for
each sub-class as determined at $z=0$ by \citet{Smartt:2009}
and \citet{Li:2011a}.  A more rigorous classification would extrapolate
these local SN class fractions to higher redshift using models or
measurements of the volumetric SN rate.  For simplicity, we do not
vary the class priors with redshift, and in practice these priors do
not have any significant impact on the resulting classification.

The final photometric classification probability for SN \tomas\ is
$p({\rm Ia}|{\rm {\bf D}})=1.0$, with the classification probability
from all \CCSN\ sub-classes totaling less than $10^{-32}$.  The
best-fit models for each sub-class are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:photoclass}, which demonstrates that the \CCSN\ models
cannot adequately match the observed photometry. In particular, only
the Type Ia model can simultaneously provide an acceptable fit to the
well-sampled rising light curve in F814W and the F814W-F160W
color near peak.

The marginal posterior distribution in redshift for the Type Ia model
is sharply peaked at $z=1.35\pm0.02$, which is fully consistent with
the photo-$z$ of the presumed host galaxy ($z=1.5\pm0.2$), and
$<2\sigma$ from the spectroscopic redshift of $z=1.31\pm0.01$ derived
in Section~\ref{sec:SpecRedshift}.  The time of peak brightness is
also tightly constrained at $t_{\rm pk}=56816.3\pm0.3$, which means
the spectroscopic observations were collected within 2 rest-frame days
of the epoch of peak brightness, consistent with our spectroscopic
analysis.


\section{Light Curve Fitting}
\label{sec:LightCurveFitting}

With the spectroscopic type and redshift securely defined as a normal
Type Ia SN at $z=1.3$, we now turn to fitting the light curve with
Type Ia templates to measure the distance modulus.  Here we use two
independent light curve fitters: the SALT2 model described
above and the MLCS2k2 model \citep{Jha:2007}.   


\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{FIG/snTomas_lightcurve_fit_fluxAB25}
\caption{ Type Ia light curve fits to SN \tomas\ using the MLCS2k2
(top row) and SALT2 (bottom row) fitters. The model redshifts are set to
$z=1.33\pm0.02$, encompassing both redshift values as determined from
spectroscopic and photometric constraints.  Solid lines denote the
best-fit model and shaded lines show the range allowed by 1-$\sigma$
uncertainties on the model parameters. 
Observed fluxes are shown as diamonds, scaled to an AB magnitude
zero point of 25. Error bars are plotted, but most are commensurate
with the size of the points. The left-most panel includes observations
in the F435W and F606W filters, although these were not used for the
fit, as they are bluer than the minimum wavelength for the model. The
lower axis marks time in observer frame days, while the top axis shows
the time in the rest frame relative to the epoch of peak brightness.
\label{fig:LightCurveFits} }
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

With both fitters we find light curve shape and color parameters that
are fully consistent with a normal Type Ia SN, regardless of whether
we adopt the spectroscopic redshift $z=1.31$ from
Section~\ref{sec:SpecRedshift} or the photometric redshift $z=1.35$
from Section~\ref{sec:PhotometricClassification}.  For SALT2, with the
redshift range set to $1.33\pm0.02$, we find a light curve shape
parameter of $x_1=0.164\pm0.199$ and a color parameter of
$c=-0.115\pm0.025$, yielding a $\chi^2$ value of 48.4 for 36 degrees
of freedom, $\nu$.  With the MLCS2k2 fitter the best-fit shape
parameter is $\Delta=-0.033\pm0.083$ and the color term is
$A_{\rm V}=0.014\pm0.037$, giving $\chi^2/\nu=23.9/36$.

\subsection{Distance Modulus}
\label{sec:DistanceModulus}

As in \P14, we derive a distance modulus\footnote{We use 'dm' to
indicate the distance modulus to avoid confusion, reserving the symbol
$\mu$ to refer to the lensing magnification. This 'dm' is a standard
distance modulus, defined as ${\rm dm}=5\log_{10}d_L+25$, where $d_L$
is the luminosity distance in Mpc.}  from the SALT2 fit using

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:dmSALT2}
 {\rm dm}_{\rm SALT2} = m_B^* - M + \alpha(s-1) - \beta C.
\end{equation}

\noindent  Here the parameters for light curve shape $s$ and color $C$ 
correspond to the SiFTO light curve fitter \citep{Conley:2008}, so we
first use the formulae from \citet{Guy:2010} to convert from SALT2
($x_1$ and $c$) into the equivalent SiFTO parameters.  We also add an
offset of 0.27 mag to the value of $m_B^*$ returned by SNANA, in order
to match the arbitrary normalization of the SALT2 fitter used
by \citet{Guy:2010} and \citet{Sullivan:2011}.  This conversion allows
us to adopt values for the constants $M$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$
from \citet{Sullivan:2011}, which have been calibrated using 472 SNe
from the SNLS3 sample \citep{Conley:2011}: $M=-19.12\pm0.03$,
$\alpha=1.367\pm0.086$, and $\beta=3.179\pm0.101$.

\input{TABLE/dist_mag}

The SNANA version of the MLCS2k2 fitter returns a value for the
distance modulus (dm$_{\rm MLCS2k2}$) that has an arbitrary zero point
offset relative to the SALT2 distances (dm$_{\rm SALT2}$).  To put the
two distances onto the same reference frame we add a zeropoint
correction of 0.20 mag to the MLCS2k2 distances as
in \P14.  This correction was derived by applying both
fitters to a sample of Type Ia SNe from the SDSS
survey \citep{Holtzman:2008,Kessler:2009b}, with the extinction law
$R_V$ fixed at 1.9.

Final values for the SN distance modulus are shown in
Table~\ref{tab:MeasuredMagnification}, both for the spectroscopic
redshift ($z=1.31$) and the photometric redshift ($z=1.35$).  The two
light curve fitters are consistent within the uncertainties. 


\subsection{Magnification}
\label{sec:Magnification}

To measure the lensing magnification, we would like to avoid
introducing systematic uncertainties inherent to any assumed
cosmological model \citep[e.g.][]{Nordin:2014}.  To that end, we
follow \P14\ and define the magnification by comparing
the measured distance modulus of SN \tomas\ against an average
distance modulus derived from a ``control sample'' of unlensed Type Ia
SN at similar redshift.  This allows us to make only the minimal
assumption that the redshift-distance relationship for Type Ia SN is
smooth and approximately linear over a small redshift span, which
should be true for any plausible cosmological model.

The unlensed sample comprises 18 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia
SNe in the range $1.14\leq z \leq1.42$ from the GOODS and SCP
surveys,\footnote{GOODS: Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey,
PI:Giavalisco, HST-PID:; SCP: Supernova Cosmology Project,
PI:Perlmutter} which used the HST Advanced Camera for
Surveys \citep{Riess:2006,Suzuki:2012}.  Using the SALT2 and MLCS2k2
fitters as described above, we get distance modulus measures for every
object in this control sample.  We then fit a linear relationship for
distance modulus vs. redshift, and derive a prediction for the
distance modulus of a normal Type Ia SN at the redshift of SN \tomas
(Figure~\ref{fig:MagnificationMeasurement}).
This predicted value is given in
Table~\ref{tab:MeasuredMagnification} under the ``Control'' column.
The difference between the observed distance of SN \tomas\ and this
control sample value is attributed to the magnification from
gravitational lensing:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:mu}
{\rm dm}_{\rm control} - {\rm dm}_{\rm \tomas} = 2.5 \log_{10}\mu.
\end{equation}

\noindent This inferred magnification is reported in the final column of
Table~\ref{tab:MeasuredMagnification}.

\subsection{Comparison to Model Predictions}
\label{sec:ComparisonToModelPredictions}

Before the Frontier Fields observations began, the Space Telescope
Science Institute (STScI) issued a call for lens modeling teams to
generate mass models of all 6 Frontier Field clusters, using a shared
collection of all imaging and spectroscopic data available at the
time.  In response to this opportunity, five teams generated eight
models for Abell 2744.  These models were necessarily quite
preliminary, and they were principally intended to be used for quick
estimation of magnifications for lensed background sources. An
interactive web tool was created by D. Coe and hosted at STScI, to
extract magnification estimates and uncertainties from each model for
any given redshift and position.  In this work we also consider three
additional models that were created later, taking advantage of new
multiply-imaged galaxies discovered in the HFF imaging as well as new
redshifts for lensed background galaxies.

\label{fig:lensingtest} }
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Table~\ref{tab:PredictedMagnifications} lists the 11 models, giving
for each one the predicted magnification and uncertainty for a source
at $z=1.31\pm0.01$ and at the position of \tomas.  These
models represent a broad sampling of the techniques and assumptions
that can be applied to the modeling of mass distributions in galaxy
clusters. A rigorous comparison of these disparate lens modeling
techniques is beyond the scope of this work. Table 10 includes a brief
description of each model, but for a complete discussion of the
methodology the reader is referred to the listed references.

In Figure~\ref{fig:lensingtest} the model predictions are plotted
alongside the observed magnification of SN \tomas, derived in
Section~\ref{sec:Magnification}.  This comparison shows that these 11
models are largely consistent with each other. Naively treating each
model as an independent prediction for the magnification (and ignoring
their quoted uncertainties), one would get a mean for the full sample
of $\mu=2.62\pm0.34$ (shown as a grey band in
Figure~\ref{fig:lensingtest}).  This is separated from the observed SN
magnification by $\delta\mu/\mu=30\%$, which is a 1.7$\sigma$
difference.

The models shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lensingtest} are separated along
the $y$ direction into two broad classes, with the six {\it
parametric} models on top and the four {\it free-form} models on the
bottom.  Broadly speaking, parametric models use parameterized density
distributions to describe the arrangement of mass within the cluster,
typically associating massive dark matter halos with the positions of
bright cluster member galaxies. Therefore, parametric models rely (to
varying degrees) on the assumption that the observed light from
cluster galaxies is a good tracer of the cluster's dark matter.
Free-form models divide the cluster into a grid, generally using an
adaptive mesh to get better sampling in denser regions. Each grid cell
is assigned a mass, and then the grid spacing and the mass values are
iteratively refined to match the observed lensing constraints.  

Figure~\ref{fig:lensingtest} also separates the models based on the
scope of input data constraints used.  Seven of the models rely only
on strong-lensing constraints (plotted as circles), while the other
four also use weak-lensing measurements (diamonds).  Eight of the
models were constructed using only pre-HFF data (open symbols), and
three others added new multiply-imaged systems and redshifts.

In spite of the great variety in input data and methodology, these
lens models overall are delivering consistent and fairly accurate
estimates of the magnification.  Furthermore, the scatter amongst
models provides a reasonable estimate of the magnification
uncertainty.  This is largely in agreement with the results
of \citetalias{Patel:2014} and \citet{Nordin:2014}.  The fact that the
model predictions are collectively within $2\sigma$ of the observed
magnification is especially encouraging for these Abell 2744
models. This is a merging cluster with a complex mass distribution,
and most of the models we are evaluating are preliminary products,
generated quickly and without access to the rich data from the
Frontier Fields program.

However, beyond this first-order agreement, there is a systematic bias
apparent. All of the lens models predict a magnification that is {\it
higher} than the observed value, and no model has a median value that
falls within the $1\sigma$ range of the observed magnifications.  It
is important to emphasize that SN \tomas\ only samples a single
sight-line through the cluster, so any conclusions to be drawn from
this analysis are necesssarily limited.  Nevertheless, a systematic shift
common to all models is surprising, given the wide range of modeling
strategies, input data, and physical assumptions represented by this
set of models.  In the following subsections we examine possible
explanations for this apparently universal bias.

\subsection{Nearby Cluster Member Galaxy}
\label{sec:NearbyClusterMemberGalaxy}

The line of sight to SN \tomas\ is 5\farcs8 from a bright cluster
member galaxy, due North of the SN position (see
Figure~\ref{fig:DiscoveryImage}).  If the mass-to-light ratio (M/L)
for this galaxy were significantly different from the M/L for other
cluster member galaxies, then its proximity to the SN sight-line could
introduce a bias in the magnification.  This bias might be
particularly acute for models that make a strict ``light traces mass''
assumption, such as the Sharon, CATS, Jauzac, GLAFIC and Zitrin-LTM
models.  

We tested this hypothesis using the Jauzac model by allowing the mass
of the nearby cluster member galaxy to vary as a free parameter in the
model. We found that the change in the SN \tomas\ magnification
prediction was less than $\Delta\mu=0.1$.  This additional dispersion
is already included in the uncertainties quoted for that model in
Table~\ref{tab:PredictedMagnifications} and
Figure~\ref{fig:lensingtest}.  Furthermore, an erroneous M/L
value for the nearby cluster member galaxy could not explain the
systematic shift of all lens models, because some do not incorporate
cluster member galaxies into their constraints at all (the free-form
Bradac, Williams and Merten models).

\subsection{Sparse Strong Lensing Constraints}
\label{sec:SparseStrongLensingConstraints}

At the outset of the HFF survey, only 33 multiply-imaged galaxies
behind Abell 2744 were known.  One might expect that the addition of
new lensing constraints from the HFF data would improve the model
constraints and reduce the tension between the predicted and observed
magnification.  However, for both of the most recent
models \citep{Jauzac:2014c,Lam:2014} that include new strong-lensing
constraints, the predicted magnification is still significantly higher
than the observed value.  Again the CATS model family provides a
useful case study.  The Jauzac model shares the same lens modeling
software (LensTool), and the same primary methodology as the earlier
CATS models.  A key difference is that the Jauzac model incorporates
many new multiply imaged galaxies and corrects a mis-identified
multiply-imaged system near the SN \tomas\ position.  These
improvements should in principle make the Jauzac model magnification
estimates more accurate, though we in fact see the opposite result:
the Jauzac model predicts a $\mu$ that is higher than the measured
value by $5.6\sigma$.

This shift to higher magnifications is not, however, unique to the
SN \tomas\ position.  \citet{Jauzac:2014c} noted that their updated
mass model of Abell 2744 results in a systematic increase in the
magnification values across the cluster field. Examining a sample of
$\sim$30 multiple images, \citeauthor{Jauzac:2014c} found that the
magnifications increased by a factor of $\sim1.5$ relative to pre-HFF
models.  Although this single sight-line can only provide a very
limited test of the model, the $5.6\sigma$ discrepancy is at least a
strong suggestion that improving the number and quality of
strong-lensing constraints can still lead to magnification maps that
are susceptible to systematic biases.

\subsection{Mass Profile Truncation}
\label{sec:MassProfileTruncation}

Seven of the mass models evaluated here are constrained only using
strong-lensing features such as multiply-imaged background galaxies
and highly magnified arcs.  There are now $\sim$150 known lensed
images behind Abell 2744 \citep{Jauzac:2014c}, but SN \tomas\ is
located several arcseconds outside the core region of the cluster
where these multiply-imaged galaxies are found.  Therefore these seven
``strong-lensing only'' models must necessarily rely on extrapolations
to provide a prediction for the SN \tomas\ magnification.  If the true
cluster density profile for Abell 2744 happens to be truncated -- with
a sharp drop right at the edge of this core strong-lensing region --
then these seven models might well overestimate the mass interior to
the \tomas\ position, and thus systematically overestimate the
magnification.

The other four models in our comparison set also use the strong
lensing constraints from the core region, but also utilize weak
lensing measurements to provide additional constraints on the mass
distribution farther from the cluster core.  The signal from weak
lensing relies on a large sample of background galaxies, so this
constraint operates principally at separations more than 1\arcmin from
the cluster core.  At a projected separation of $\sim40\arcsec$,
SN \tomas\ falls in between the strong- and weak-lensing regimes, and
one would expect that models incorporating both of those constraints
would be less susceptible to the systematic bias of a truncated mass
profile.  The lowest magnification estimate in our sample (from the
Merten model) is among this sub-sample.  However, we find that
collectively these four strong+weak models (shown as diamonds in
Figure~\ref{fig:lensingtest}) exhibit the same propensity to
overestimate the magnification along this line of sight.  Thus, a
sudden change in the mass profile outside the strong lensing region is
not a likely explanation for this small systematic bias.

With two versions of the CATS model, we also have a more direct test
of the effect of introducing weak lensing constraints.  The initial
CATS model uses only strong-lensing constraints, and gives
$\mu=2.27^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, slightly higher than the measured value.
A second iteration of this model, labeled here as CATS-SL+WL, used the
same strong-lensing features, but added in weak lensing constraints.
The revised magnification of $\mu=2.62\pm0.18$ is further from the
measured value, which serves to reinforce the conclusion that adding
weak lensing constraints cannot resolve this bias.


\subsection{Redshift Error}
\label{sec:RedshiftError}

If the redshift of the SN derived in Section~\ref{sec:Spectroscopy}
were incorrect, then one would derive a different value for the
magnification, both from the SN measurement and the lens model
predictions.  Conceivably, this could resolve the tension between the
measurement and the models.  It is often the case in SN surveys that
redshifts are assigned based on a host galaxy association, typically
inferred from the projected separation between the SN and nearby
galaxies.  In this case the redshift evidence comes from the SN
itself, and we find a consistent redshift from both the SN spectrum
(Section~\ref{sec:SpecRedshift}) and the light curve
Section~\ref{sec:PhotometricClassification}, which are both within the
$1\sigma$ range of the photometric redshift for the nearest detected
galaxy: $z=1.5\pm0.2$. This appears to be a solid and self-consistent
picture, so the evidence strongly disfavors any redshift that is
significantly different from $z=1.3$.

We have adopted the spectroscopic redshift of $z=1.31\pm0.01$ for the
magnification comparison.  Spectroscopic redshifts are generally more
precise and accurate than those derived from photometric
observations \citep{Rodney:2010b,Kessler:2010,Sako:2011}.  However, in
this case the spectrum is limited to the rest-frame near-UV
wavelengths, where the available SN spectral template libraries are
more limited than at optical wavelengths.  If we use the photometric
redshift of $z=1.35\pm0.02$ instead, then the measured magnification
is reduced. \footnote{By increasing the redshift, the SN is presumed
to be at a greater distance, so to first order one would be expect it
to appear slightly fainter (larger distance modulus). If the distance
modulus inferred from the light curve fit remained constant, this
would drive the inferred magnification to a higher value.  However,
the intrinsic peak brightness as derived from light curve fitting is
more strongly affected by the covariance between redshift, color, and
light curve width.  In this case, these effects drive the distance
modulus to a larger value at $z=1.35$ that is closer to the unlensed
population than we get at $z=1.31$.}  From the SALT2 fitter we derive
$\mu_{\rm SALT2}=1.80\pm0.30$ and from MLCS2k2 we get $\mu_{\rm
MLCS2k2}=1.83\pm0.17$.  The lens models are also shifted, and they
uniformly move in the opposite direction, to magnification values that
are {\it larger}, by $\sim1$\%.  Thus, shifting the SN to the
photometric redshift of $z=1.35$ only serves to (slightly) exacerbate
the tension between the observations and models.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:SummaryAndConclusions}

The appearance of a Type Ia SN behind a massive galaxy cluster
provides a rare opportunity to use a standard candle for a direct
measurement of the absolute magnification due to gravitational
lensing.  The discovery of SN \tomas\ in the HFF imaging of Abell 2744
offers the first chance to apply this test on a cluster with multiple
publicly-available lens models.  We have found that the spectrum and
light curve of SN \tomas\ are well matched by templates of a normal
Type Ia SN at $z=1.31\pm0.01$.  Using the two most prevalent \SNIa\
light curve fitters, SALT2 and MLCS2k2, we get a consistent
measurement of the distance modulus
(Table~\ref{tab:MeasuredMagnification}).  Using a
cosmology-independent comparison against a sample of unlensed \SNeIa\
at similar redshifts, we find that SN \tomas\ is $\sim0.7$ magnitudes
brighter than the field sample would predict.  Attributing this
difference to the gravitational lensing magnification (and accounting
for the intrinsic scatter in luminosity of the \SNIa\ population), we
have derived a consistent measured magnification of $\mu_{\rm
SALT2}=1.89\pm0.29$.  $\mu_{\rm MLCS2k2}=2.00\pm0.19$, from the two
light curve fitters.

Taking advantage of the availability of eleven well-constrained lens
models for the Abell 2744 cluster, we have used SN \tomas\ to ask
how accurately these lens models can predict the magnification along
this line of sight.   We find that these models are consistent, and
fairly accurate, collectively predicting $\mu=2.60\pm0.34$.  This is
encouraging, and reinforces the quality and value of these public lens
models for studying magnified background objects.   However, the fact
that all models predict a larger magnification value than we observe
is an indication that there is a small systematic bias inherent to
this cluster or sight-line. 

We have speculated on the possible origin of this systematic bias,
evaluating three possible causes: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item The close proximity of a cluster member galaxy is leading to a
biased magnification, because that galaxy's M/L is atypical.
\item The models are limited by a scarcity of strong lensing constraints
\item The cluster mass profile exhibits a sudden change outside of the core
strong-lensing region, where we lack multiply-imaged background
sources to constrain it. 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent None of these three explanations is completely
satisfactory.  For each of these scenarios, we would expect that
certain subsets of the available lens models would be less sensitive
to the proposed systematic bias.  However, the small discrepancy
between the predicted and observed lensing magnification is persistent
when we bifurcate the sample of lens models according to methodology
(parametric vs. free-form), number of strong-lensing constraints (pre-
vs post-HFF), and scope of lensing constraints (strong-lensing only
vs. strong+weak).  We do not have any definitive explanation for this
magnification discrepancy.

This single object behind a single cluster is not in and of itself a
cause for alarm.  Previous analyses of lensed \SNIa\ found no
significant discrepancy beween the observed \SNIa\ magnifications and
the predictions from lens models
(\citetalias{Patel:2014}; \citealt{Nordin:2014}), albeit with a much
smaller set of lens models being tested.  The observed systematic bias
for \tomas\ is small, and many of the lens models being evaluated are
preliminary models that have not been updated to include all of the
HFF data.  Future revisions of the lens models for Abell 2744 should
either incorporate the observed magnification of \tomas\ as a new
model constraint, or can revisit this test to evaluate whether the
bias persists.

Increasing the sample of SNe behind well studied strong lensing
clusters would allow this test to be repeated and refined.  With 10 or
100 such objects, it would be possible to see whether the SN \tomas\
$\mu$ discrepancy is simply an outlier, or an indication of a more
pernicious systematic error.  Any cluster that has been vetted by
pencil-beam magnification tests using lensed \SNIa\ will be able to
provide a more reliable measure of the magnifications for very high
redshift objects.  Similarly, a broad sample of SNe like \tomas\ would
help to define the preferred lens modeling methodology by highlighting
any models that consistently perform well in \SNIa\ lensing tests.
The ongoing FrontierSN program will discover and follow any more
highly magnified SNe that appear behind the Frontier Field
clusters. Unfortunately, the HFF survey is not designed with high-z
transient discovery as a primary science goal, so the FrontierSN
effort will likely add no more than 1-3 new lensed \SNIa. Further
imaging of strong-lensing clusters with \HST\ or the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) could enable a larger sample to be collected,
especially if the filters and cadence are optimized for detection
of \SNIa\ at $z>1$.  Massive clusters such as Abell 2744 will continue
to be attractive as cosmic telescopes, allowing the next generation of
telescopes to reach the faintest objects in the very early universe.
The puzzling bias revealed by SN \tomas\ supports a concerted effort
to improve these lenses with a larger sample of magnified SNe.
